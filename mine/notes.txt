Ch 2:
    Recursive definitions of "expression," "term," and "factor":
    expression ::= [+-] <term> [+- <term>]*
    term ::= <factor> [*/ <factor>]*
    factor ::= (<expression>)
    factor ::= -<digit>
    factor ::= <digit>
    
Ch 3:
    Factor can also be a variable (or a function call):
    factor ::= <variable>
    factor ::= <func call>
